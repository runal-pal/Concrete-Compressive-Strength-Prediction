# Concrete-Compressive-Strength-Prediction
Machine Learning Project - Determining the Concrete Compressive Strength
Context:
Determining the Concrete Compressive Strength
The Compressive Strength of Concrete determines the quality of 
Concrete. This is generally determined by a standard crushing test on 
a concrete cylinder. This requires engineers to build small concrete 
cylinders with different combinations of raw materials and test these 
cylinders for strength variations with a change in each raw material. 
The recommended wait time for testing the cylinder is 28 days to
ensure correct results. This consumes a lot of time and requires a lot 
of labour to prepare different prototypes and test them.
Also, this method is prone to human error and one small mistake can 
cause the wait time to drastically increase. One way of reducing the 
wait time and reducing the number of combinations to try is to make 
use of digital simulations, where we can provide information to the 
computer about what we know and the computer tries different 
combinations to predict the compressive strength. This way we can 
reduce the number of combinations we can try physically and reduce
the amount of time for experimentation.

Objective:
Concrete is the most important material in civil engineering. The 
concrete compressive strength (CCS) is a function of age and 
ingredients. These ingredients include cement, blast furnace slag, fly 
ash, water, superplasticizer, coarse aggregate, and fine aggregate. Find 
the relation between CCS and the independent features using 
statistical models and use the same for prediction.
